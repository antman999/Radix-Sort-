# Radix-Sort
###### Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers, it never makes comparison like other sorting algorithms and exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits 

Creates buckets for numbers starting from the Right most side.
```
//[345,673,1,67,876,32,44,2,67,10]
//   ^   ^ ^  ^   ^  ^  ^ ^  ^  ^ 
//Creates a bucket and groups them based on the right most digit
